# TDD: Write Better Code Faster
This repository is the source code for my presentation *Test Driven Development: Write Better Code, Faster*.
The tool used to write this presentation is [spectacle](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle) a React based presentation library.
To build the presentation run `npm run build` or `npm run start` (which starts a server so that you can view the presentation on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Abstract

Everyone knows they should be writing tests.  But fewer understand the
difference between "writing tests" and "test driven development".  The
latter is a process for software development that doesn't just result
in tests, it results in faster progress and cleaner code by helping
you organize your thought process while you work.
